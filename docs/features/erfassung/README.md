# Erfassung - AI-Powered Product Cataloging

## Overview
Erfassung is an integrated feature of the Formular platform that transforms physical products into structured data tables through AI-powered photo analysis and automated e-commerce integration. The system creates comprehensive product tables with 21 standardized fields, supports advanced export formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON, XML, TSV), and automates the complete workflow from photo capture to online shop publication.

## Vision & Roadmap
Erfassung represents Formular's expansion into AI-powered business process automation. The feature demonstrates how form-building technology can be applied to complex data entry workflows beyond traditional forms.

**Current Phase**: Planning and Architecture  
**Next Phase**: MVP Development  
**Future Phases**: Multi-tenant deployment, advanced AI features, ERP integrations

## Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (consistent with Formular)
- **Backend**: Node.js, tRPC, Prisma ORM (extending existing Formular stack)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision, Tesseract OCR, custom classification models
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (extending existing Formular schema)
- **Storage**: Cloud storage for photos and generated exports

## Integration Points
Erfassung deeply integrates with existing Formular systems:
- **User Management**: Uses existing authentication and organization systems
- **Form Technology**: Product data forms leverage Formular's dynamic form system
- **UI Components**: Extends existing component library with Erfassung-specific components
- **Background Jobs**: Uses existing job queue system for AI processing
- **API Layer**: Extends existing tRPC routers with Erfassung endpoints
