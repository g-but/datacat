### LLM Analysis Types

1. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Emotional tone assessment
   - Satisfaction level detection
   - Sentiment trends over time

2. **Classification**
   - Automatic categorization
   - Tag generation
   - Priority assessment

3. **Key Information Extraction**
   - Important data points
   - Entity recognition
   - Action item identification

4. **Summary Generation**
   - Executive summaries
   - Detailed analysis
   - Highlight extraction

5. **Custom Analysis**
   - User-defined prompts
   - Domain-specific analysis
   - Custom insights

### Context Integration

```typescript
interface AnalysisContext {
  formData: Record<string, any>;
  businessContext: {
    goals: string[];
    constraints: string[];
    resources: Record<string, any>;
    priorities: string[];
  };
  historicalData: {
    previousSubmissions: Submission[];
    trends: AnalysisTrend[];
    patterns: AnalysisPattern[];
  };
  externalContext: {
    marketConditions: Record<string, any>;
    competitiveLandscape: Record<string, any>;
    regulatoryRequirements: string[];
  };
}
```

## API Architecture

### tRPC Router Structure

```typescript
const appRouter = router({
  users: userRouter,           // User management
  forms: formsRouter,          // Form CRUD and sharing
  submissions: submissionsRouter, // Response collection
  llmAnalysis: llmAnalysisRouter, // AI analysis
  analytics: analyticsRouter,  // Insights and reporting
  integrations: integrationsRouter, // Third-party integrations
});
```
