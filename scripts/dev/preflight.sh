# Preflight: make the working copy match reality before any work starts.
#
# Why this exists: session after session burned part of a run repairing the
# same class of entry-time drift, each time discovering it the hard way —
#   2026-08-29  local main held a commit origin never got; `git pull --ff-only`
#               failed for every run entering the repo.
#   2026-08-31  local main was 2 commits behind origin (#232, #233).
#   2026-09-02  local main was 3 commits behind (#234-#236), two merged
#               worktrees were still checked out, and `frontend/node_modules`
#               predated the prettier devDependency added in #233 — so the very
#               first gate of `npm run verify` died on "prettier: not found",
#               which looks like a repo bug and is not one.
#   2026-09-04  #243 migrated npm -> pnpm (package-lock.json -> pnpm-lock.yaml)
#               but this check still watched package-lock.json; once that file
#               was deleted, `[[ -f "$lock" ]] || continue` made the freshness
#               check a silent no-op for both packages, so a checkout still
#               holding the old npm-flat node_modules — five commits and a
#               package-manager migration stale — reported "clean".
#   2026-09-08  #254 removed contentlayer and its ignore entry; the generated
#               directory it left behind was suddenly in prettier's scope, and
#               `pnpm run verify` exited 2 on an unmodified main.
# A bare `git status` reports "clean" in all these cases. This closes the class.
#
# Usage: pnpm run preflight   (read-only by default)
#        pnpm run preflight --fix   (fast-forward, prune, reinstall)
